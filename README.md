## :cloud: Installation

Fireup your terminal/cmdüìü
```sh
# Using Git
git clone https://github.com/codingwithzaz/ChatConnect-Pro
```

```sh
cd ChatConnect-Pro
```

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
playwright install firefox # Regards server.py
```
if you want any other browser instead of firefox, such as webkit/chrome then you have to change the browser in server.py file also

```sh
python server.py
```
Login for the first time

> At the same time, you have to run the ```whatsapp``` client also, that is ```main.go``` file.
For this Fireup amother terminal/cmd and goto the same folder "ChatConnect-Pro" and run the following command
```
go run main.go
```
> It will automatically install the required go packages

if you get the following error:
> panic: failed to upgrade database: Binary was compiled with 'CGO_ENABLED=0', go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work. This is a stub
> goroutine 1 [running]:
> main.main()
>        C:/Users/vmwar/ChatConnect-Pro/main.go:74 +0x46e
> exit status 2

Run the following command in the same terminal/cmd
```
set CGO_ENABLED=1
```

> If you get the 'gcc' error, make sure you have installed the correct version of TDM-GCC

```go
go run main.go
```
> First time it will take 5-10 to run completely!

### üåê Browser Configuration

To configure the browser settings for the ChatConnect-Pro project, follow these instructions:

- To switch the browser from Firefox to Chrome, locate the following line of code in the `server.py` script:

```python
BROWSER = PLAY.firefox.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir=PROFILE_DIR, headless=True)
```

- Replace `firefox` with `chrome` to switch the browser to Chrome.

- Additionally, you can change the headless mode by modifying the `headless=True` parameter. Setting it to `True` enables headless mode, which runs the browser without a user interface, making it ideal for automated tasks. Setting it to `False` activates the browser's graphical interface, allowing real-time visualization during script execution.

### üíª Headless Mode

The headless mode enables the browser to operate without a graphical user interface, allowing it to run in the background. This mode is particularly useful for automated tasks and server-side operations where a visible browser window is not required. It significantly reduces resource consumption and enhances the efficiency of the automation process.


### get_last_message function

time.sleep function at specific lines within the get_last_message function:

```python
# Wait for the latest message to appear on the page
while True:
    time.sleep(1)  # Delays the execution for 1 second
```

At this line, time.sleep(1) introduces a one-second delay in the loop. This delay allows the function to periodically pause its execution, enabling it to wait for the latest message to appear on the ChatGPT interface. This approach ensures that the function doesn't excessively consume system resources by continuously checking for updates and that it waits for a reasonable time before proceeding to retrieve the most recent message.

```python
time.sleep(0.2)  # Checks whether the message is being generated & adds Small delay to reduce CPU usage
# Increase the delay if ChatGPT is creating slow response in the browser, preferrably change it to '3'.
```

In this line, time.sleep(0.2) introduces a smaller delay of 0.2 seconds. This short pause is implemented to reduce CPU usage during the iterative process of checking and updating the latest message. By incorporating this small delay, the function optimizes its performance by reducing unnecessary computational load while ensuring that it captures the most recent non-empty message accurately.

The strategic use of time.sleep at these specific lines demonstrates the function's efficient and optimized approach to wait for and retrieve the latest non-empty message from the ChatGPT interface, enhancing the overall performance and resource management of the ChatConnect-Pro project.
